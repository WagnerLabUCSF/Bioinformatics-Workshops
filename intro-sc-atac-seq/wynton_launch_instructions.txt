##On wynton create directory in the space you can run analyses on - You can change to whichever location on your account
mkdir /gladstone/bioinformatics/projects/scatac_workshop

##move into this directory
cd /gladstone/bioinformatics/projects/scatac_workshop

##copy arrow files for the demo to the directory that you just created


##download the singularity container
singularity pull docker://ruben6um/scatac_workshop_demo_2

##give the container access to the relevant directory 
dataDir=/gladstone/bioinformatics/projects/scatac_workshop/
export APPTAINER_BINDPATH="$dataDir"

##launch the container
singularity exec $dataDir/scatac_workshop_demo_2_latest.sif R

##sequentially copy paste lines of code to run  in ArchR_demo_2_analysis.Rmd in the R session
